Fusion of infrared and visible images for night-vision context enhancement

Find the files GFCE.m and HMSD_GF.m in the folder "Context_Enhance_via_Fusion" to implement 
the proposed algorithms

GFCE.m ----- an implementation of the GFCE through fusion of infrared and visible images.

HMSD_GF.m ----- an implementation of the HMSD fusion method based on the guided filter (HMSD-GF)
