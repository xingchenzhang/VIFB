# <center>VIFB：A Visible and Infared Image Fusion Benchmark</center>
This is the official webpage of VIFB. 

**VIFB is the first (and the only one to date) benchmark in the field of visible-infrared image fusion (VIF)**, aiming to provide a platform to perform fair and comprehensive performance comparision of VIF algorithms. Currently, **21 image pairs, 20 fusion algorithms and 13 evaluation metrics** are integrated in VIFB, which can be utilized to compare performances conveniently. All the fusion results are also available that can be used by users directly. In addition, more test images, fusion algorithms (in Matlab), evaluation metrics and fused images can be easily added using the provided toolkit.

## Abstract
Visible and infrared image fusion is an important area in image processing due to its numerous applications. While much progress has been made in recent years with efforts on developing fusion algorithms, there is a lack of code library and benchmark which can gauge the state-of-the-art. In this paper, after briefly reviewing recent advances of visible and infrared image fusion, we present a visible and infrared image fusion benchmark (VIFB) which consists of **21 image pairs, a code library of 20 fusion algorithms and 13 evaluation metrics**. We also carry out large scale experiments within the benchmark to understand the performance of these algorithms. By analyzing qualitative and quantitative results, we identify effective algorithms for robust image fusion and give some observations on the status and future prospects of this field.

## What are contained in VIFB

### Dataset
The dataset in VIFB is a test set, which is collected by the authors from the [Internet](https://www.ino.ca/en/solutions/video-analytics-dataset/) and from fusion tracking datasets [1,2,3]. Image registration between RGB and infrared images are also conducted by corresponding authors. We appreciate the authors of these datasets very much for making these images publicly available for research. **Please also cite these papers and the [link](https://www.ino.ca/en/solutions/video-analytics-dataset/) if you use VIFB**. Thanks!

The download links of each algorithm can be found on [this website](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/342971809). For each algorithm, we use original settings reported by corresponding authors in their papers. For deep learning-based methods, the pretrained model provided by corresponding authors are used. We did not train these algorithms.

We modified the interfaces of these algorithms to run them in VIFB conveniently. For other methods written in MATLAB, they can also be added to VIFB by chaning the interface. For algorithms written in Python or other languages, we suggest the users change the name of the fused images and put them in the output folder. Then the evaluation methods can be computed by finishing correponding settings.

### Evaluation metrics integrated
We have integrated 13 evaluation metrics in VIFB. The codes are collected from the Internet, forum, etc. and checked the authors. 

Many thanks to the authors of these evaluation metric codes for sharing their codes with the community. Please forgive us because we can not find the original source of these codes so we can not mention everyone here. Please let us know if you think you are the authors of these evaluation metric codes and we will add references and acknowledgements. Many thanks!

### Examples of fused images
![](https://github.com/xingchenzhang/Visible-infrared-image-fusion-benchmark/blob/master/fusion-fight.jpg)


## How to use
### How to run algorithms
1. Please set the algorithms you want to run in util\configMethods.m
2. Please set the images you want to fuse in util\configImgsVI.m and util/configImgsIR.m, and change the path of these images
3. DLF and ResNet methods need MatConvNet to run. One should set the path to MatConvNet in run_ DLF.m (line 28) nad run_ ResNet.m (line 10), respectively.
4. DLF requires 'imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat' to run. Please download it and put it inside methods\DLF
5. ResNet requires 'imagenet-resnet-50-dag.mat' to run. Please download it and put it inside methods\ResNet\models
6. To run GFF, please set your own path in run_GFF.m (line 17) 
7. To run MST_SR for the first time, please run "make" in the path "...\methods\MST_SR\sparsefusion\ksvdbox\ompbox\private". Similarly, to run RP_SR for the first time, run "make" in the path "...\methods\RP_SR\sparsefusion\ksvdbox\ompbox\private". To run NSCT_SR for the first time, run "make" in the path "...\methods\NSCT_SR\sparsefusion\ksvdbox\ompbox\private".
8. main_running.m is used to run the fusion algorithms. Please change the output path in main_running.m.
9. Enjoy!


### How to compute evaluation metrics
1. Please set the metrics you want to compute in util\configMetrics.m
2. compute_metrics.m is used to compute evaluation metrics. Please change the output path in compute_metrics.m
3. Enjoy!

### How to add algorithms (or fused images)
1. For methods written in MATLAB, please put them in the folder methods. For example, for method "ADF", put the codes inside a folder called "ADF", and put the folder "ADF" inside "Methods". Then change the main file of ADF to run_ADF.m. In run_ADF.m, please change the interface as according to examples provided in VIFB.
2. For algorithms written in Python or other languages, we suggest the users change the name of the fused images  according to examples provided and put them in the output folder. Then add the methods in util\configMethods.m. Then, the evaluation metrics can be computed.
